       "- Double threads (so lead L = number of threads Ã— pitch)\n",

Wait, the problem says dc = 40 mm, which is probably the collar diameter. Maybe fc is the coefficient for the collar? But the question says f = fc = 0.08, so both are 0.08. Hmm.)\n",
       "- Load F = 6.4 kN per screw.\n",
       "\n",
       "Part (a): Find thread depth, thread width, pitch diameter, minor diameter, and lead.\n",
       "\n",
       "Starting with lead. Since it's a double-threaded screw, lead L = number of threads Ã— pitch. So L = 2 Ã— 4 mm = 8 mm. That's straightforward.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thread depth: For a square-threaded screw, the thread depth is typically half the pitch. Wait, is that correct? Or is it related to the major diameter? Wait, maybe the thread depth is the depth of the thread, which for a square thread is equal to half the pitch? Let me think. In square threads, the thread is a square-shaped profile. The depth of the thread would be equal to half the pitch because the pitch is the distance between threads. Wait, actually, the pitch is the axial distance between threads. For a square thread, the depth of the thread is equal to half the pitch. Wait, but if the pitch is 4 mm, then the thread depth would be 2 mm? But I need to confirm this. Alternatively, maybe the thread depth is equal to the pitch divided by 2. Let me check.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yes, for square threads, the depth of the thread is half the pitch. Because the thread has a square profile, so the height of the thread is half the pitch. So thread depth = p/2 = 4 mm / 2 = 2 mm. Okay, that seems right.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thread width: For square threads, the width of the thread is the same as the depth. Wait, no. Wait, the width would be the width of the thread in the radial direction? Wait, maybe the width is the same as the depth. Wait, in a square thread, the thread is a square, so the width (i.e., the width of the thread in the radial direction) is the same as the depth. Wait, but the pitch is the distance between threads. Let me think. If the pitch is 4 mm, then the distance between two adjacent threads is 4 mm. Since it's a square thread, the thread has a square profile. So the width of the thread would be the same as the depth. Wait, but in terms of the major diameter, the thread is cut into the screw. The depth would be from the major diameter to the minor diameter. So if the depth is p/2, then minor diameter would be major diameter minus twice the depth. Wait, but that might be for a single thread. Wait, but since it's double-threaded, maybe that affects the minor diameter?\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, maybe I need to recall the formulas for square-threaded screws. The minor diameter (also called the root diameter) is calculated as the major diameter minus twice the thread depth. So if thread depth is p/2, then minor diameter d_min = d - 2*(p/2) = d - p. Wait, let me check. For a square thread, the thread depth is p/2. Therefore, minor diameter is major diameter minus twice the thread depth. Because each thread has depth p/2, so from the major diameter to the root, it's p/2. Therefore, minor diameter would be d - 2*(p/2) = d - p. So for this case, d_min = 32 mm - 4 mm = 28 mm. Wait, but is that correct? Let me check with standard formulas.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, the formula for minor diameter (d3) in square threads is d3 = d - p. Yes, because the thread depth is p/2, so subtracting twice that from the major diameter gives d3 = d - p. So that seems correct. So minor diameter is 32 mm - 4 mm = 28 mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "But wait, the problem says \"thread width\". What's thread width? Maybe the width of the thread in the axial direction? Or radial? Wait, thread width might refer to the width of the thread in the radial direction. But for square threads, the width is the same as the depth. Wait, but in square threads, the thread is a square, so the width in the axial direction is equal to the depth. Wait, no, the width in the radial direction would be the same as the depth. Wait, maybe the thread width is the width of the thread in terms of the profile. Since it's square, the width is the same as the depth. But since the pitch is the distance between threads, maybe the thread width is p/2? Wait, but I need to confirm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, maybe thread width is the width of the thread in the radial direction, which for square threads is equal to the pitch. Wait, that can't be. Wait, the pitch is the axial distance between threads. For square threads, the thread width (in the axial direction) would be equal to the pitch. Wait, but if the pitch is 4 mm, and the thread has a square profile, then the width of the thread in the axial direction would be equal to the pitch. But that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the thread width refers to the width of the thread in the radial direction. Let me think. If the screw has a square thread, the thread has a square cross-section. So in the radial direction (i.e., from the major diameter to the minor diameter), the depth is p/2. The width of the thread in the axial direction would be the same as the pitch. Wait, but that seems like the pitch is the distance between threads, so between two adjacent threads, there is a space of p. But since the thread is square, the width of the thread in the axial direction would be p. Wait, but if the thread is square, then the width (in the axial direction) is equal to the pitch. Wait, but if that's the case, then the thread width is equal to the pitch. But that would mean that the width is p, but the depth is p/2. However, that seems like the thread would have a width of p and depth of p/2. But since it's square, the width and depth should be the same. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to refer to the standard definitions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, for square threads, the thread profile is a square, so the width of the thread (in the axial direction) is equal to the depth. Wait, but how does that relate to the pitch? If the pitch is the axial distance between two adjacent threads, then the width of the thread plus the space between threads would be equal to the pitch. Wait, but since it's a square thread, the thread is in contact with the nut. So the width of the thread would be such that when you have two adjacent threads, the distance between them is the pitch. So if the width of the thread is w, then the space between threads is also w, making the pitch p = w + w = 2w. Therefore, w = p/2. Therefore, the width of the thread in the axial direction is p/2. Which would be same as the depth. So thread depth is p/2 = 2 mm, thread width is also p/2 = 2 mm. So thread depth and thread width are both 2 mm. But I need to confirm this.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, maybe thread width refers to the width of the thread in the radial direction. But that would be the depth, which is p/2. Wait, but in that case, thread depth and thread width are the same. Maybe the question is using \"thread width\" as the width of the thread in the axial direction, which would be p/2. So thread depth is p/2, thread width is p/2. Therefore, both are 2 mm. But I need to check if that's the standard terminology. Maybe in some references, thread width refers to the width in the axial direction, which is p/2. So I think that's acceptable here. So thread depth is 2 mm, thread width is 2 mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then pitch diameter. Wait, pitch diameter is the diameter of the screw at which the thread thickness is equal to the pitch. For square threads, the pitch diameter is the same as the major diameter minus half the pitch. Wait, let me think. Wait, pitch diameter is usually calculated as the average of the major and minor diameters. For square threads, since the thread depth is p/2, minor diameter is d - p. Therefore, pitch diameter d2 would be (d + d_min)/2 = (d + d - p)/2 = d - p/2. Wait, but d is the major diameter. So pitch"

Wait, no, the mean diameter for a screw is generally the average of the major and minor diameters. However, if the minor diameter isn't given, perhaps we can approximate it? Wait, but maybe the problem expects us to use the formula for the lead screw torque, which might require the mean diameter. Alternatively, since the collar diameter dc is given as 40 mm, maybe that's used for the collar friction? Wait, part (b) mentions torque required to raise and lower the load. The given data includes f = fc = 0.08, which might be the friction factors for the thread and collar. Wait, the question says f = fc = 0.08.

For square threads, the thread height is p / 2, so d_m = d - p / 2. Wait, but if the pitch is 4 mm, then the thread height is p / 2 = 2 mm. Therefore, d_m = 32 mm - 2 mm = 30 mm. Is that correct?\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, sometimes the mean diameter is approximated as the major diameter for simplicity, but I think for precise calculation, we need to use the actual mean diameter. Let me check.\n",

Wait, no, for square threads, the minor diameter is d - p, because the thread height is p / 2 on both sides. So, the major diameter is d, the minor diameter is d - p. Therefore, the mean diameter would be (d + (d - p)) / 2 = d - p / 2. So yes, that confirms it. Therefore, d_m = 32 mm - 4 mm / 2 = 32 - 2 = 30 mm.\n",

       "First, the screw has a major diameter of 32 mm and a pitch of 4 mm with double threads. So, the lead (l) would be the product of the number of threads and the pitch. Since it's double threads, that's 2 threads, so lead l = 2 * 4 mm = 8 mm. Got that down.\n",

       "Next, thread depth and width for square threads. The context says that for square threads, thread depth and width are equal and equal to half the pitch. The pitch is 4 mm, so half of that is 2 mm. Therefore, both thread depth and width are 2 mm each. That seems straightforward.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, pitch diameter. The context mentions that pitch diameter is the difference of the major diameter and half of the pitch. Wait, major diameter is 32 mm. Half the pitch is 4 mm / 2 = 2 mm.

The context says \"pitch diameter is the difference of major diameter and half of pitch.\" So yes, subtract half the pitch from the major diameter. So 32 mm - 2 mm = 30 mm. That seems right.\n",
       "\n",
       "Minor diameter is the difference of major diameter and pitch. So major diameter is 32 mm, pitch is 4 mm. So minor diameter is 32 mm - 4 mm = 28 mm. Wait, but for square threads, the minor diameter is typically the major diameter minus twice the thread depth, right? Wait, but the context says minor diameter is difference of major diameter and pitch. Hmm, maybe that's specific to square threads? Wait, the context says \"For a square threaded screw, thread depth and thread width are equal and is equal to half the pitch. pitch diameter is the difference of major diameter and half of pitch. minor diameter is the difference of major diameter and pitch.\" So according to that, minor diameter is major diameter minus pitch. So 32 mm - 4 mm = 28 mm. Okay, I'll go with that as per the context.\n",

       "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about a square-thread power screw. The question has three parts: finding some dimensions, calculating torque for raising and lowering the load, and determining efficiency.\n",
       "\n",
       "Starting with part (a). The problem gives the major diameter as 32 mm, pitch of 4 mm, and it's a double-thread screw. So, the first thing I need to recall is the formulas related to screw threads.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thread depth: For a square thread, the depth is usually half the pitch, right? Wait, but square threads have a specific depth. Let me check. In square threads, the depth is equal to half the pitch. Wait, but sometimes it's considered as the pitch divided by two. Since the pitch is the distance between threads, and the thread depth would be the height of the thread. So maybe thread depth is pitch/2. Since it's double-threaded, does that affect the depth? Hmm, maybe not. The thread depth is determined by the pitch. So if the pitch is 4 mm, then thread depth would be 4/2 = 2 mm. But I need to confirm this.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then thread width. Thread width is the width of the thread, which is the same as the pitch for square threads? Wait, no. Wait, in square threads, the width of the thread is equal to the pitch divided by two? Wait, maybe not. Wait, square threads have a square profile, meaning that the width of the thread is equal to the pitch. Wait, no, that can't be right. If the pitch is the distance between threads, then the width of the thread would be half the pitch? Wait, confusion here.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, maybe I need to recall the definitions. For a square thread, the thread profile is a square, meaning that the height of the thread is equal to the width. So the depth of the thread is equal to the width. So if the pitch is the distance between adjacent threads, then the thread depth (which is the same as the width) would be half the pitch? Because the pitch is the sum of the thread width and the space between threads. Wait, but in square threads, the thread is a square, so the width of the thread is equal to the height. But since it's a square thread, the width of the thread is equal to the height. However, the pitch is the distance between the same points on adjacent threads. So if the thread has a width, then the pitch would be equal to twice the thread width? Because the thread width plus the space between threads (which is also the thread width) would be the pitch. Wait, but square threads have no clearance, right? Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up with other thread types.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, perhaps for square threads, the depth is equal to half the pitch. Let me check some references. Wait, since I can't look it up, I need to think. In square threads, the thread is square in cross-section. So the depth is the height of the thread, which is the same as the width of the thread. The pitch is the distance between threads. So if you imagine a square thread, the width of the thread would be equal to the pitch divided by two. Wait, maybe not. If you have a square thread, the pitch would be equal to the width of the thread plus the width of the space between threads. But since square threads are designed to have maximum efficiency, perhaps they have no clearance, so the width of the thread is equal to the pitch. Wait, that can't be because then the thread would be too thick. Maybe I need to think of the lead.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, the lead is the distance the screw advances per revolution. For a double-threaded screw, the lead is twice the pitch. Since the pitch is 4 mm, lead would be 2*4 = 8 mm. That part I can confirm.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, moving on. The major diameter is given as 32 mm. The minor diameter is the diameter at the bottom of the thread. For square threads, the minor diameter is equal to the major diameter minus twice the thread depth. Since thread depth is pitch/2, which is 4/2 = 2 mm. Therefore, minor diameter would be 32 - 2*2 = 32 - 4 = 28 mm. Wait, but that might be for single-thread. Wait, but since it's double-threaded, does that affect the minor diameter? Probably not. The minor diameter is determined by the thread depth, which is same as single-thread. So regardless of the number of threads, the minor diameter would be major diameter minus twice the thread depth.\n",
       "\n",
       "But wait, thread depth is pitch/2? Let me think again. For square threads, the thread depth is equal to the pitch divided by two. Yes, because the pitch is the distance between adjacent threads. Since the thread has a square profile, the depth is half the pitch. So thread depth is 4 mm / 2 = 2 mm. Then thread width is same as thread depth, so 2 mm. Wait, but thread width is the width of the thread. Since square threads have square profile, the width of the thread is same as depth. Therefore, thread width is 2 mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the pitch diameter. The pitch diameter is the diameter of the screw at the pitch line. For square threads, the pitch diameter is the same as the major diameter minus the thread depth. Wait, no. Wait, for a square thread, the pitch diameter is the same as the major diameter minus the thread depth. Wait, but I think the pitch diameter is calculated as major diameter minus the thread depth. Wait, let me recall. For a screw thread, the pitch diameter is the diameter at which the thread thickness is equal to the space between threads. For square threads, since the thread has a square profile, the pitch diameter is the same as the major diameter minus the thread depth. Wait, but since the thread depth is half the pitch, then pitch diameter is major diameter minus thread depth. So, major diameter is 32 mm, thread depth is 2 mm. Therefore pitch diameter is 32 - 2 = 30 mm? Wait, but I need to confirm this.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, for square threads, the pitch diameter can be calculated as the major diameter minus the thread depth. Wait, but if the thread depth is half the pitch, then yes. So if the major diameter is 32 mm, thread depth is 2 mm, then pitch diameter is 32 - 2 = 30 mm. That seems right.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but maybe I should think about the formula for pitch diameter. For a square thread, the pitch diameter is the same as the mean diameter. Which is the average of major and minor diameters. Wait, but if minor diameter is major diameter minus 2*thread depth. Then average would be (major + minor)/2 = (32 + (32 - 2*2))/2 = (32 + 28)/2 = 30 mm. Yes, that matches. So pitch diameter is 30 mm.\n",

       "So for part (a):\n",
       "\n",
       "Thread depth: pitch/2 = 4/2 = 2 mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thread width: same as thread depth, so 2 mm.\n",

       "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about a square-thread power screw. The question has three parts, so I need to handle each part carefully. Let me start with part (a).\n",
       "\n",
       "Part (a) asks for the thread depth, thread width, pitch diameter, minor diameter, and lead. Let me recall the formulas for square threads. \n",
       "\n",
       "First, the major diameter is given as 32 mm. The pitch is 4 mm, and it's a double-threaded screw. For square threads, the thread depth is usually half the pitch, right? Wait, no. Wait, for square threads, the depth is equal to the pitch divided by 2? Hmm. Wait, no. Wait, the thread depth for square threads is actually equal to half the pitch. Because the thread is square, so the height of the thread is half the pitch. Wait, but for a single-threaded screw, the lead is equal to the pitch. For a double-threaded, the lead is twice the pitch. But the thread depth... Hmm. Maybe I need to check that.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, the thread depth for square threads is actually equal to half the pitch. Because the square thread has a depth that is equal to half the pitch. For example, if the pitch is 4 mm, the depth would be 2 mm. So that's the thread depth. So that's straightforward.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the thread width. For square threads, the width of the thread is the same as the depth, right? Because it's a square thread, so the width is equal to the depth. So if the depth is 2 mm, the width is also 2 mm. Wait, but maybe not. Wait, the width of the thread is the width of the thread in the axial direction. Wait, perhaps the thread width is the same as the depth? Let me think. In a square thread, the thread is a square, so the width is equal to the depth. So if the depth is 2 mm, then the width is also 2 mm. So that would be the thread width. So that's straightforward.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now the pitch diameter. The pitch diameter is calculated as the major diameter minus half the pitch. Wait, no. Wait, for square threads, the pitch diameter is the major diameter minus half the pitch. Wait, actually, the formula for pitch diameter is major diameter minus half the pitch. Wait, but let me recall. For a single-threaded screw, the pitch diameter is major diameter minus half the pitch. But for square threads, it's similar. So, if the major diameter is 32 mm, and the pitch is 4 mm, then pitch diameter would be 32 - (4/2) = 32 - 2 = 30 mm? Wait, but that seems too simple. Wait, maybe not. Wait, actually, the pitch diameter is calculated as major diameter minus half the pitch. So yes, 32 - 2 = 30 mm. That seems right.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the minor diameter. The minor diameter is the major diameter minus twice the thread depth. Because the thread depth is the depth of the thread, so from the major diameter, you subtract twice the depth to get the minor diameter. Wait, if the depth is 2 mm, then minor diameter is 32 - 2*2 = 28 mm. Wait, that seems correct. So that's the minor diameter.\n",
       "\n",
       "The lead is the distance the screw moves per revolution. For a double-threaded screw, the lead is twice the pitch. So since the pitch is 4 mm, the lead is 2*4 = 8 mm. That's straightforward.\n",
       "\n",
       "So summarizing part (a):\n",
       "\n",
       "Thread depth: half the pitch, so 4/2 = 2 mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thread width: same as depth, so 2 mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Pitch diameter: major diameter - half pitch = 32 - 2 = 30 mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Minor diameter: major diameter - 2*(thread depth) = 32 - 4 = 28 mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lead: 2 * pitch = 8 mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Okay, that seems straightforward. Let me check again. For square threads, the thread depth is half the pitch. Yes, that's correct. The width is the same as the depth. The pitch diameter is major minus half the pitch. The minor diameter is major minus 2*depth. The lead is number of threads times pitch. So for double threads, 2*4=8. Correct.\n",
