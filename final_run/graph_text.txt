In Fig. 8–5 a square-threaded power screw with single thread having a mean
diameter $d_m$ , a pitch p, a lead angle λ, and a helix angle ψ is loaded by the axial
compressive force F. We wish to find an expression for the torque required to raise
this load, and another expression for the torque required to lower the load.
First, imagine that a single thread of the screw is unrolled or developed (Fig. 8–6)
for exactly a single turn. Then one edge of the thread will form the hypotenuse of a right
triangle whose base is the circumference of the mean-thread-diameter circle and whose
height is the lead. The angle λ, in Figs. 8–5 and 8–6, is the lead angle of the thread. We
represent the summation of all the axial forces acting upon the normal thread area by F.
To raise the load, a force $P_R$ acts to the right (Fig. 8–6a), and to lower the load, $P_L$ acts
to the left (Fig. 8–6b). The friction force is the product of the coefficient of friction f
with the normal force N, and acts to oppose the motion. The system is in equilibrium
under the action of these forces, and hence, for raising the load, we have
$F_x = P_R − N*sin(λ) − f*N*cos(λ)= 0$ - (a)
$F_y = −F − f*N*sin(λ) + N*cos(λ)=0$ - (a)
In a similar manner, for lowering the load, we have
$F_x = −P_L − N*sin(λ) + f*N*cos(λ)=0$ -(b)
$F_y = −F + f*N*sin(λ) + N*cos(λ)=0$ -(b)

Since we are not interested in the normal force N, we eliminate it from each of these
sets of equations and solve the result for P. For raising the load, this gives
$P_R =F*\frac{(sin(λ) + f*cos(λ))}{cos(λ) − f*sin(λ)}$ - (c)
and for lowering the load,
$P_L =F*\frac{( f*cos(λ) − sin(λ))}{cos(λ) + f*sin(λ)}$ - (d)

Next, divide the numerator and the denominator of these equations by cos λ and use
the relation $tan(λ) = l/π*d_m$ (Fig. 8–6). We then have, respectively,
$P_R =F*{[(l/π*d_m ) + f]}{1 − ( f*l/π*d_m )}$ - (e)
$P_L =F*{[f−(l/π*d_m)]}{1+(f*l/π*d_m)}$ - (f)

Finally, noting that the torque is the product of the force P and the mean radius $d_m /2$,
for raising the load we can write
$T_R =F*d_m*\frac{(l + π*f*d_m)}{2*(π*d_m − f*l)}$ - (8–1)
where $T_R$ is the torque required for two purposes: to overcome thread friction and to
raise the load.
The torque required to lower the load, from Eq. ( f ), is found to be
$TL =F*d_m*{π*f*d_m − l}{2*(π*d_m + f*l)}$ - (8–2)
This is the torque required to overcome a part of the friction in lowering the load.
So the torque require to raise the load is 
$T_R=\frac{F*d_m}{2}*\frac{l+\pi*f*d_m}{\pi*d_m-f*l}+\frac{F*f_c*d_c}{2}$
and torque require to lower the load is
$T_L=\frac{F*d_m}{2}*\frac{\pi*f*d_m-l}{\pi*d_m+f*l}+\frac{F*f_c*d_c}{2}$  

It may turn out, in specific instances where the lead is large or the friction is low, that the load
will lower itself by causing the screw to spin without any external effort. In such cases,
the torque $T_L$ from Eq. (8–2) will be negative or zero. When a positive torque is
obtained from this equation, the screw is said to be self-locking. Thus the condition
for self-locking is
$π *f* d_m > l$
Now divide both sides of this inequality by $π*d_m$ . Recognizing that $l/(π*d_m)$ = tan λ, we
get $f > tan(λ)$ - (8–3)

This relation states that self-locking is obtained whenever the coefficient of thread
friction is equal to or greater than the tangent of the thread lead angle.
An expression for efficiency is also useful in the evaluation of power screws. If
we let f = 0 in Eq. (8–1), we obtain
$T_0 =\frac{Fl}{2π}$ - (g)
which, since thread friction has been eliminated, is the torque required only to raise the load. 
The efficiency is therefore
$e=\frac{T_0}{T_R}=\frac{F*l}{2*π*T_R}$ - (8–4)

The preceding equations have been developed for square threads where the nor-
mal thread loads are parallel to the axis of the screw. In the case of Acme or other
threads, the normal thread load is inclined to the axis because of the thread angle 2α
and the lead angle λ. Since lead angles are small, this inclination can be neglected
and only the effect of the thread angle (Fig. 8–7a) considered. The effect of the angle
α is to increase the frictional force by the wedging action of the threads. Therefore
the frictional terms in Eq. (8–1) must be divided by cos α. For raising the load, or for
tightening a screw or bolt, this yields
$TR =Fd_m{l + π*f*d_m*sec(α))}{2*(πd_m − f*l*sec(α))}$ - (8–5)
In using Eq. (8–5), remember that it is an approximation because the effect of the
lead angle has been neglected.

For power screws, the Acme thread is not as efficient as the square thread, because
of the additional friction due to the wedging action, but it is often preferred because
it is easier to machine and permits the use of a split nut, which can be adjusted to
take up for wear.

Usually a third component of torque must be applied in power-screw applications.
When the screw is loaded axially, a thrust or collar bearing must be employed between
the rotating and stationary members in order to carry the axial component. Figure 8–7b
shows a typical thrust collar in which the load is assumed to be concentrated at the
mean collar diameter dc . If {f_c} is the coefficient of collar friction, the torque required is
$T_c =\frac{F f_c d_c}{2}$ - (8–6)
For large collars, the torque should probably be computed in a manner similar to that
employed for disk clutches.

Nominal body stresses in power screws can be related to thread parameters as follows. 
The maximum nominal shear stress t in torsion of the screw body can be expressed as
$\tau=\frac{16*T}{\pi*d_r^3}$
The axial stress s in the body of the screw due to load F is
$\sigma=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{4*F}{\pi*d_r^2}$ - (8–8)
in the absence of column action. For a short column the J. B. Johnson buckling for
mula is given by Eq. (4–43), which is
$(\frac{F}{A})_{crit}=S_y-\frac{S_y*l}{2*\pi*k}(\frac{1}{C*E})$ - (8–9)

 Nominal thread stresses in power screws can be related to thread parameters as 
follows. The bearing stress in Fig. 8–8, $\sigma_B$, is
 $\sigma_B=-\frac{F}{\pi*d_m*n_t*p/2}$ - (8–10)
 where $n_t$ is the number of engaged threads. The bending stress at the root of the thread 
$\sigma_b$ is found from
$Z=\frac{I}{c}=\frac{(\pi*d_r*n_t)(p/2)^2}{6}=\frac{\pi}{24}*d_r*n_t*p^2$
$M=\frac{F*p}{4}$, so
$\sigma_b=\frac{M}{Z}=\frac{6*F}{\pi*d_r*n_t*p}$ - (8–11)

The transverse shear stress $\tau$ at the center of the root of the thread due to load F is
$\tau=\frac{3V}{2A}=\frac{3*F}{\pi*d_r*n_t*p}$ - (8–12)
and at the top of the root it is zero. The von Mises stress $\sigma^{'}$ at the top of the root 
“plane” is found by first identifying the orthogonal normal stresses and the shear
stresses. From the coordinate system of Fig. 8–8, we note
$\sigma_x=\frac{6*F}{\pi*d_r*n_t*p}$ and $\tau_{xy}=0$
$\sigma_y=-\frac{4*F}{\pi*d_r^2}$ and $\tau_{xy}=\frac{16T}{\pi*d_r^3}$
$\sigma_z=0$ and $\tau_{xy}=0$
 then use Eq. (5–14) of Sec. 5–5. Using xyz components of three-dimensional stress, the von Mises stress can be written as
$\sigma^'=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}*[(\sigma_x-\sigma_y)^2+(\sigma_y-\sigma_z)^2+(\sigma_z-\sigma_x)^2+6*(\tau_{xy}^2+\tau_{yz}^2+\tau_{zx}^2)]^{1/2}$ - (5-14)
 and for plane stress,
$\sigma^{'}=(\sigma_x^2+\sigma_x*\sigma_y+\sigma_y^2+3*\tau_{xy}^2)^{1/2}$
	
The screw-thread form is complicated from an analysis viewpoint. Remember 
the origin of the tensile-stress area At, which comes from experiment. A power screw 
lifting a load is in compression and its thread pitch is shortened by elastic defor
mation. Its engaging nut is in tension and its thread pitch is lengthened. The engaged 
threads cannot share the load equally. Some experiments show that the first engaged 
thread carries 0.38 of the load, the second 0.25, the third 0.18, and the seventh is 
free of load. In estimating thread stresses by the equations above, substituting 0.38F 
for F and setting $n_t$ to 1 will give the largest level of stresses in the thread-nut 
combination.

For a square threaded screw, thread depth and thread with are equal and is equal to half the pitch.
pitch diameter is the difference of major diameter and half of pitch.
minor diameter is the difference of major diameter and pitch.
lead (l) is the product of number of threads and pitch.

total efficiency to raise the load is  $e=\frac{F*l}{2*\pi*T_R}$, 
The bearing stress $\sigma_B$ is, with one thread carrying 0.38F is $\sigma_B=-\frac{2*0.38*F}{\pi*d_r*p}$,
body stress due to torsinal moment or lifting load torque is $\tau=\frac{16*T_R}{\pi*d_r^3}$,
body stress due to compressive moment or axial nominal normal stress is $\sigma=-\frac{4*F}{\pi*d_r^2}$,
The thread-root bending stress $\sigma_b$ with one thread carrying 0.38F is $\sigma_b=\frac{6*0.38*F}{\pi*d_r*p}$,
where F is the load, l is the lead, $T_R$ is the torque require to raise the load, $d_r$ is the minor diameter.
 the three principal shear stresses $\tau_{1/2}$, $\tau_{2/3}$, $\tau_{1/3}$
Each of these occurs on the two planes. The principal shear stresses are given by the equations
 $\tau_{1/2}=\frac{\sigma_1-\sigma_2}{2}$ and $\tau_{2/3}=\frac{\sigma_2-\sigma_3}{2}$ and $\tau_{1/3}=\frac{\sigma_1-\sigma_3}{2}$ - (3–16)
 Of course, $\tau_{max}=\tau_{1/3}$ when the normal principal stresses are ordered (\sigma_1>\sigma_2>\sigma_3), 
so always order your principal stresses.
