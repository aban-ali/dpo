       "Assistant: (a) For a square thread, the thread depth and width are the same and equal to half the pitch. So, the thread depth and width are both 2 mm. The pitch diameter (Dp) is the major diameter (D) minus half the pitch (P). So, Dp = 64 - 4/2 = 62 mm. The minor diameter (Dm) is the pitch diameter minus the pitch. So, Dm = 62 - 4 = 58 mm. The lead (L) is the pitch (P) times the number of threads per unit length. Since it's a double thread screw, there are 2 threads per unit length. So, L = 4 * 2 = 8 mm.\n",

       "(b) To find the torque required to raise the load, we can use the formula:\n",
       "\n",
       "TR = F * dm * (L + π * f * dm) / (2 * (π * dm - f * L))\n",
       "\n",
       "where TR is the torque required, F is the load, dm is the mean diameter, L is the lead, and f is the coefficient of friction. The mean diameter (dm) is the average of the major diameter (D) and the minor diameter (Dm). So, dm = (64 + 58) / 2 = 61 mm.\n",
       "\n",
       "Substituting the values into the formula, we get:\n",
       "\n",
       "TR = 8000 * 61 * (8 + π * 0.08 * 61) / (2 * (π * 61 - 0.08 * 8))\n",
       "TR = 8000 * 61 * (8 + 5.008π) / (2 * (61π - 0.64))\n",
       "TR = 8000 * 61 * (8 + 15.71) / (2 * (194.78 - 0.64))\n",
       "TR = 8000 * 61 * 23.71 / (2 * 194.14)\n",
       "TR = 8000 * 61 * 23.71 / 388.28\n",
       "TR = 3241600 / 388.28\n",
       "TR = 8340.8 N*mm\n",
       "\n",
       "To find the torque required to lower the load, we can use the same formula, but with the opposite direction of the friction force. So, the torque required to lower the load is:\n",
       "\n",
       "TL = F * dm * (L - π * f * dm) / (2 * (π * dm + f * L))\n",
       "\n",
       "Substituting the values into the formula, we get:\n",
       "\n",
       "TL = 8000 * 61 * (8 - 5.008π) / (2 * (61π + 0.64))\n",
       "TL = 8000 * 61 * (8 - 15.71) / (2 * (194.78 + 0.64))\n",
       "TL = 8000 * 61 * (-7.71) / (2 * 195.42)\n",
       "TL = -3241600 / 390.84\n",
       "TL = -8301.6 N*mm\n",
       "\n",
       "However, the negative sign indicates that the torque is in the opposite direction, which means it's acting to lower the load. So, the torque required to lower the load is 8301.6 N*mm.\n",
